### Project description
In this project, we are developing an Android app with Java. We are implementing some basic functionalities for searching Movies from Finnkino API. Users should be able to search movies based on date, location, etc. We're also going to use IMDB API to get actors, ratings, and other information for a certain movie. Users can create their own account with password verification and biometric identification.
